### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My Name's AbdelGhani Hammoud, I am a 42 starfleet Cadet.
I consider myself Computers friend from very young age, also i love music, photography and handmade stuff. "like MR GARAK (ST DS9) I am a man of many talents".
and because i ve been living on Ferenginar I learned the the Holy Rules of acquisition revised by the Grand Nagus Quark.
"A wise man can hear profit in the wind." Rule #22, that's why i launched a startup just after high school not a big deal, just the usual commerce.
