### Hi there 👋
[![<username>'s 42 stats](https://badge.mediaplus.ma/darkblue/ahammoud)](https://github.com/oakoudad/badge42)
My Name's AbdelGhani Hammoud; I am a 42 Starfleet Cadet.

Before following my passion for Code I was studying sound Engineering , i worked on some music festivals, studios & movies.

I consider myself a Computers friend from a very young age, also I love music, photography and handmade stuff. "like MR GARAK (ST DS9) I am a man of many talents".


And because I've been living on Ferenginar, I learned the Holy Rules of acquisition revised by the Grand Nagus Quark.

"A wise man can hear profit in the wind." Rule #22, that's why I launched a startup just after finishing high school, not a big deal, just the usual ferengi  commerce. 


In case you don't Know Mr Garak & The Grand Nagus Quark >>>
